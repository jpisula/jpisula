# Hi there, I'm Jakub 👋

I'm a **Senior Frontend Developer** with 7+ years of experience building fast, scalable and user-focused web applications. I specialize in **React**, **TypeScript**, and modern frontend architecture — but I also enjoy going full-stack when needed (Node.js, REST, GraphQL).

### 🛠️ What I do
- Build modern, high-performance apps with a focus on UX and maintainability
- Collaborate closely with designers and product teams to ship features users love
- Mentor developers and contribute to team growth
- Write clean, testable code and obsess over details

### 💻 Tech I enjoy
`React` · `TypeScript` · `Next.js` · `Tailwind` · `Node.js` · `Jest` · `React Testing Library` · `REST` · `GraphQL`

### 🌱 Currently exploring
- `C#` and `.NET` for backend development
- Design systems & UI/UX patterns
- Frontend architecture and DX improvements
